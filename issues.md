# CTI-AIU Control Framework: Identified Issues and Enhancement Opportunities

This document outlines areas for improvement in the CTI-AIU Control Framework for GenAI in Cyber Threat Intelligence. These issues were identified during a comprehensive review of the whitepaper and individual control documents.

## Identified Issues

### Issue #01: Version Number Inconsistency
**Status:** ðŸ”´ OPEN
**Description:** There is inconsistency in version numbers across framework documents. Some files show Version 1.0, while others show Version 1.0.0, creating confusion about the current version.

### Issue #02: Status Badge Inconsistency
**Status:** ðŸ”´ OPEN
**Description:** The status badges are inconsistent across files. Some documents use "Final" status while others use "Draft" status. This creates confusion about the readiness state of different components.

### Issue #03: Empty Example Implementations
**Status:** ðŸ”´ OPEN
**Description:** The examples directory structure exists, but many subdirectories appear to be empty. Implementation examples referenced in the documentation may not be available yet.

### Issue #04: Badge and Link Verification
**Status:** ðŸ”´ OPEN
**Description:** Some badge links and external resources may need verification to ensure they point to valid repositories and current resources.

### Issue #05: Control Maturity Level Indicators
**Status:** ðŸ”´ OPEN
**Description:** While there's a maturity model described in the whitepaper, the individual control documents don't clearly indicate which maturity level (Foundational, Established, or Advanced) they belong to.

### Issue #06: Implementation Guide Specificity
**Status:** ðŸ”´ OPEN
**Description:** Some implementation guidance sections may be too general and could benefit from more specific, actionable recommendations for different organization sizes and contexts.

### Issue #07: Appendix Format Consistency
**Status:** ðŸ”´ OPEN
**Description:** The appendices have inconsistent formatting - some use tables while others use bullet points or narrative text, which impacts readability and consistency.

### Issue #08: Roadmap Implementation Tracking
**Status:** ðŸ”´ OPEN
**Description:** The newly expanded roadmap includes comprehensive implementation examples, validation scenarios, audit tooling, and configuration templates, but lacks a formal tracking mechanism to measure progress against these deliverables. A project tracking system or detailed milestone document is needed to ensure these items are developed according to the timeline.
