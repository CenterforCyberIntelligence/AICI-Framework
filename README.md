A community-driven control framework for the responsible use of Generative AI (GenAI) in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) operations. Developed through open collaboration, the framework establishes key controls that ensure GenAI enhances, rather than compromises, intelligence tradecraft.

## 📋 Framework Overview

The framework introduces the Artificial Intelligence Use (CTI-AIU) control family specifically designed for GenAI applications in threat intelligence contexts. These controls cover:

- Ethical use enforcement
- Human oversight requirements
- Model risk assessment
- Data integrity and provenance
- Red teaming and adversarial evaluation
- Transparency and community accountability

### Core Controls:

- [CTI-AI-1](./CTI-AI-1.md): Use of Generative AI in CTI
- [CTI-AI-2](./CTI-AI-2.md): Ethical Use Enforcement
- [CTI-AI-3](./CTI-AI-3.md): Human Oversight Requirement
- [CTI-AI-4](./CTI-AI-4.md): Model Risk Assessment and Validation
- [CTI-AI-5](./CTI-AI-5.md): Data Integrity Controls
- [CTI-AI-6](./CTI-AI-6.md): Red Teaming and Model Evaluation
- [CTI-AI-7](./CTI-AI-7.md): Transparency and Community Accountability

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Read [Whitepaper.md](./Whitepaper.md) to explore the control framework.
- Review individual controls (CTI-AI-*.md) for detailed requirements.
- Review [DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md](./DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md) for document formatting guidelines.
- Check [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for version history and recent updates.
- Explore [examples/](./examples/) for implementation guidance and practical templates.
- Review [CONTRIBUTE.md](./CONTRIBUTE.md) to learn how to provide feedback or suggest enhancements.

## 💡 How to Contribute

The CTI-AIU Control Framework is designed to be a community-driven standard that evolves with the rapid advancement of GenAI capabilities and threat landscapes. Contributors from CTI teams, AI/ML engineers, governance professionals, and security researchers are encouraged to participate.

To contribute:

1. Review individual controls and provide enhancement suggestions
2. Test controls in your environment and share feedback
3. Suggest new controls or implementation examples
4. See [CONTRIBUTE.md](./CONTRIBUTE.md) for more.

## 📋 Implementation Resources

The framework includes practical implementation resources to help organizations operationalize the controls:

- **Policy Templates**: Ready-to-customize templates for acceptable use, ethical guidelines, and governance
- **Workflow Documentation**: Detailed human oversight and verification workflow examples
- **Technical Implementations**: Data provenance tracking, metadata schemas, and API specifications
- **Prompt Engineering**: Templates and security patterns for effective GenAI use in CTI
- **Integration Guidance**: Code examples for integrating with common CTI platforms

These resources are available in the [examples/](./examples/) directory, organized by control and implementation type.
