## Key Examples

### Implementation Guidance

- [CTI-AI-1: Acceptable Use Policy Template](./implementation/CTI-AI-1/policy_templates/acceptable_use_policy.md)
- [CTI-AI-3: Human Oversight Workflow](./implementation/CTI-AI-3/review_workflows/human_oversight_workflow.md)
- [CTI-AI-5: Data Provenance Tracking](./implementation/CTI-AI-5/data_provenance/data_provenance_tracker.md)

### Prompt Engineering

- [Threat Actor Analysis Template](./prompt_engineering/templates/threat_actor_analysis.md)

## Usage Guidelines

These examples are designed to be:

1. **Adaptable**: Customize to your organization's specific needs, scale, and environment
2. **Practical**: Focused on real-world implementation rather than theoretical concepts
3. **Comprehensive**: Covering technical, procedural, and governance aspects
4. **Empirically Grounded**: Based on established CTI practices and AI governance principles

Organizations should:

- Use these examples as starting points for their own implementations
- Adapt templates to their specific regulatory and operational environments
- Consider their organizational maturity when selecting implementation approaches
- Integrate with existing cybersecurity and CTI processes

## Contribution Guidelines

To contribute additional examples:

1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Provide realistic implementation details
4. Test examples in real or simulated environments when possible
5. See [CONTRIBUTE.md](../CONTRIBUTE.md) for more information

## Relationship to Controls

All examples in this directory directly support one or more CTI-AIU controls:

| Example Type | Supported Controls | Implementation Focus |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Policy Templates | CTI-AI-1, CTI-AI-2 | Governance and ethical use enforcement |
| Workflow Documentation | CTI-AI-3, CTI-AI-7 | Human oversight and accountability |
| Data Handling | CTI-AI-5 | Data integrity and provenance |
| Prompt Engineering | CTI-AI-1, CTI-AI-2, CTI-AI-4 | Effective and secure GenAI use |
| Testing Scenarios | CTI-AI-4, CTI-AI-6 | Risk assessment and red teaming |
