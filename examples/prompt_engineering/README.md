# Prompt Engineering Guidelines for CTI-AIU Control Framework

This directory contains prompt engineering guidelines, templates, and examples for effective and secure use of Generative AI in Cyber Threat Intelligence operations. These resources help implement the CTI-AIU control requirements regarding prompt design, security, and effective use.

## Purpose

The prompt engineering guidelines provide:
- Structured templates for common CTI tasks
- Security patterns to prevent prompt injection
- Effectiveness strategies to maximize intelligence value
- Risk mitigation techniques to prevent hallucinations
- Domain-specific considerations for cybersecurity contexts

```

## Security Guidelines

When designing prompts for CTI operations, always:

1. **Define Clear Boundaries**: Explicitly state limitations and constraints to prevent model excursions beyond appropriate bounds
2. **Validate Inputs**: Sanitize any user or external inputs incorporated into prompts
3. **Implement Content Filtering**: Include explicit instructions to filter harmful or unethical outputs
4. **Use Structured Formats**: Request outputs in specific structured formats to improve consistency and validation
5. **Incorporate Verification Requirements**: Include instructions for the model to cite sources or indicate confidence levels
6. **Layer Multiple Defenses**: Combine technical controls, prompt design, and human review

## Effective Prompting for CTI

Effective prompts for cyber threat intelligence:

1. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information for the specific intelligence question
2. **Set Clear Expectations**: Explicitly define the expected output format and detail level
3. **Leverage Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Incorporate cybersecurity terminology and frameworks
4. **Request Multiple Perspectives**: Ask for alternative hypotheses or explanations
5. **Specify Confidence Indicators**: Request explicit indications of certainty levels
6. **Define Source Requirements**: Specify requirements for source attribution
7. **Create Multi-Step Analyses**: Break complex intelligence questions into sequential steps

## Integration with CTI-AIU Controls

These prompt engineering guidelines specifically support:

- **CTI-AI-1**: By providing structured templates for acceptable GenAI use
- **CTI-AI-2**: Through security patterns that enforce ethical constraints
- **CTI-AI-3**: By designing prompts that facilitate human oversight and verification
- **CTI-AI-4**: Through risk mitigation techniques for model-level risks
- **CTI-AI-5**: By incorporating data integrity validation requirements
- **CTI-AI-6**: Through examples that support red team testing scenarios
- **CTI-AI-7**: By promoting transparency in prompt design and usage

## Usage Guidelines

1. Always start with a template appropriate for your specific intelligence task
2. Customize the template with relevant context and requirements
3. Incorporate appropriate security patterns based on the sensitivity of your task
4. Test prompts with validation techniques before operational use
5. Document effective prompts for organizational knowledge sharing
6. Review and update prompts as models and threats evolve
