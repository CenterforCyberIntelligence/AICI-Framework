# Generative AI Acceptable Use Policy for Cyber Threat Intelligence Operations

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes guidelines for the acceptable use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) systems within [ORGANIZATION NAME]'s Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) operations. It applies to all personnel engaged in intelligence collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination activities that utilize GenAI capabilities.

**Scope includes:**
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Image generation systems
- Code generation tools
- Multi-modal AI systems
- Fine-tuned or custom GenAI models
- Third-party GenAI services and APIs

## 2. Authorized Use Cases

GenAI systems are authorized for the following CTI activities:

| Activity | Permitted Use | Restrictions |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Intelligence summarization | Condensing technical reports, news, and raw data | Must maintain factual accuracy and source attribution |
| Threat actor analysis | Pattern recognition and behavioral profiling | Requires human verification and multiple source validation |
| Report generation | First-draft creation, formatting, and translation | Final products require human review and explicitly labeled AI contributions |
| Malware analysis | Code explanation and similarity analysis | Must verify outputs against trusted analytical tools |
| Vulnerability assessment | Initial categorization and context enrichment | Critical impact assessments require manual verification |
| Tactical intelligence | Alert triage and prioritization | Time-critical recommendations need human approval |
| Strategic intelligence | Trend analysis and emerging threat identification | Forecasts must indicate confidence levels and limitations |

## 3. Prohibited Uses

The following uses of GenAI in CTI operations are explicitly prohibited:

1. **Attribution without verification**: Using GenAI outputs to attribute cyber activity to specific threat actors without independent human analysis and multi-source validation
2. **Unauthorized data exposure**: Inputting classified, sensitive, or personally identifiable information (PII) into non-approved GenAI platforms
3. **Unacknowledged use**: Presenting GenAI-generated content as human analysis without appropriate disclosure
4. **Autonomous decision-making**: Allowing GenAI systems to make operational security decisions without human review
5. **Deceptive prompt engineering**: Attempting to bypass ethical safeguards or manipulate GenAI systems to produce harmful or misleading outputs
6. **Reliance on hallucinated data**: Using GenAI-generated "facts" without verification against trusted sources

## 4. User Responsibilities

Personnel utilizing GenAI for CTI activities must:

1. Complete required training on GenAI capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations
2. Maintain awareness of model-specific tendencies, biases, and known issues
3. Verify all GenAI outputs against trusted sources before operational use
4. Document all prompt inputs and system outputs used in intelligence products
5. Report anomalous or concerning GenAI behavior to the security team
6. Adhere to all data handling policies when using GenAI systems
7. Maintain appropriate classification boundaries when using GenAI tools
8. Clearly identify GenAI contributions in intelligence products
9. Apply critical thinking and subject matter expertise to evaluate outputs

## 5. Approved Models and Platforms

Only the following GenAI systems and platforms are approved for CTI operations:

| Model/Platform | Approval Level | Use Restrictions |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| [APPROVED MODEL 1] | General use | No classified data |
| [APPROVED MODEL 2] | Restricted use | Internal network only |
| [APPROVED MODEL 3] | Limited use | Pre-approved prompts only |
| [APPROVED MODEL 4] | Special authorization | Requires supervisor approval |

Use of unapproved GenAI systems for CTI purposes is prohibited. Requests for new model approvals must be submitted to the [SECURITY GOVERNANCE TEAM].

## 6. Documentation and Logging Requirements

All GenAI usage in CTI operations must be documented as follows:

1. **Prompt logging**: Record all significant prompts used for intelligence generation
2. **Output preservation**: Maintain copies of unedited GenAI outputs used in intelligence products
3. **Model metadata**: Document the specific model, version, and configuration used
4. **Human review evidence**: Record reviewer identity and verification steps taken
5. **Usage auditing**: Maintain logs of access to and use of GenAI systems

Documentation must be retained according to the organization's data retention policies, with a minimum retention period of [RETENTION PERIOD].

## 7. Human Oversight and Review

All GenAI-generated content used in CTI operations must undergo human review:

| Intelligence Level | Review Requirement |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Tactical (immediate) | Single analyst verification |
| Operational (ongoing) | Lead analyst approval |
| Strategic (long-term) | Team lead and senior analyst verification |
| Critical severity | Multi-analyst consensus and management approval |

Review processes must include:
1. Fact-checking against reliable sources
2. Assessment of analytical rigor and logic
3. Evaluation of potential biases or limitations
4. Verification of source attributions

## 8. Incident Response

If a GenAI system produces harmful, inaccurate, or compromised outputs:

1. Immediately cease using the affected system
2. Document the incident including prompts, outputs, and observed issues
3. Report the incident to [SECURITY TEAM] within [TIMEFRAME]
4. Isolate any affected intelligence products
5. Cooperate with incident investigation
6. Implement required remediation steps

## 9. Training Requirements

Personnel must complete the following training before using GenAI for CTI operations:

1. Initial GenAI capabilities and limitations training
2. Model-specific training for approved systems
3. Ethical considerations in AI-assisted intelligence
4. Annual refresher training
5. Prompt engineering best practices

## 10. Policy Violations

Violations of this policy may result in:

1. Immediate revocation of GenAI access privileges
2. Additional training requirements
3. Disciplinary action up to and including termination
4. Legal action if applicable

## 11. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed annually or after significant changes to GenAI capabilities by the [GOVERNANCE TEAM].

**Last Review Date:** [DATE]  
**Next Review Date:** [DATE]  
**Policy Owner:** [TITLE/ROLE]
