## A Community-Driven AI Controls Framework
### **Preface**

The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents transformative opportunities and novel risks to cyber threat intelligence (CTI). As organizations increasingly seek to automate and augment analytical processes, integrating GenAI into intelligence workflows must be guided by rigorous, ethical, and verifiable standards. This document proposes a community-driven framework for the responsible use of GenAI in CTI environments.

Developed through open collaboration, this standard ensures that GenAI systems enhance human judgment, reinforce analytic integrity, and prevent harm. It draws upon principles of traditional intelligence tradecraft, contemporary AI governance, and operational cybersecurity. The controls herein are designed to be adaptable across commercial, governmental, and nonprofit sectors, regardless of organizational size or mission scope.

This standard should be viewed as both prescriptive and iterative. As GenAI capabilities evolve, so will the threat landscape and the potential for misuse. Stakeholders are encouraged to actively participate in refining this framework, contributing test cases, empirical data, and real-world applications that inform its development.

## Executive Summary

The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) introduces both transformative potential and significant risk within Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). The need for ethical and verifiable usage standards becomes urgent as CTI teams explore GenAI for use cases such as report drafting, threat actor profiling, and behavioral analysis. This white paper introduces the **Artificial Intelligence Use (AIU)** control family, a framework modeled after NIST SP 800-53, tailored to ensure responsible GenAI deployment in CTI workflows. While this standard is focused on intelligence operations, the controls presented here are broadly applicable across other cybersecurity functions, including incident response, security operations, and vulnerability management.

---
## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Standard

The purpose of this standard is to define the technical, ethical, and operational controls necessary to deploy GenAI technologies in support of cyber threat intelligence activities. It is intended to:

- Safeguard the accuracy, objectivity, and credibility of GenAI-supported intelligence outputs.
- Provide structured guidance for integrating GenAI into existing CTI workflows.
- Identify and mitigate risks associated with model bias, hallucination, misuse, and overreliance.
- Encourage community transparency and collective accountability.
- Promote alignment with existing security, privacy, and AI governance regulations.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite the growing use of GenAI in CTI, no formal standards exist to guide its ethical and operational integration. Risks such as hallucination, data poisoning, and model manipulation remain poorly understood or addressed, particularly in high-stakes analytic environments.

The use of GenAI in CTI should be guided by a clearly defined ethical framework, co-developed with community stakeholders, and updated as model capabilities evolve. The standard promotes transparent collaboration and collective oversight across the intelligence community, encouraging shared responsibility for the stewardship of AI-enabled analysis.

### 1.3 Scope and Audience
#### 1.3.1 **Scope**

This standard applies to any organization employing Generative AI in collecting, processing, analyzing, producing, or disseminating cyber threat intelligence. It encompasses the use of GenAI models for:

- Threat actor profiling
- Attack surface and vulnerability analysis
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Natural language summarization
- Automated reporting and briefing generation
- Hypothesis testing and scenario simulation

The framework does not prescribe specific tools, vendors, or model architectures. Instead, it defines technology-agnostic requirements and enhancements that should be implemented regardless of the underlying GenAI platform.

#### 1.3.2 **Audience**

This standard is intended for cyber intelligence professionals, security leaders, AI/ML engineers, legal and compliance teams, and researchers engaged in CTI. It is especially relevant for organizations seeking to deploy GenAI in production environments where output fidelity, provenance, and ethical application are paramount.

### 1.4 **Authority and Governance**

The [Center for Cyber Intelligence](https://centerforcyberintelligence.org) (CCI) maintains this standard, a community-led initiative focused on defining best practices for cyber intelligence. While this document is not a regulatory mandate, it is intended to serve as a de facto benchmark for GenAI use in cyber threat intelligence operations. Community participation is encouraged through public working groups, version-controlled contributions, and continuous feedback.

### 1.5 **Structure of the Standard**

Controls are organized into functional families, consistent with established frameworks such as NIST SP 800-53. Each control includes:

- A control identifier (e.g., CTI-AI-1)
- A control statement
- A set of optional but recommended control enhancements
- Implementation guidance
- Contextual notes as needed

This structure supports high-level policy adoption and low-level operational execution, providing flexibility for integration across maturity levels.

## 2. Background and Rationale

### 2.1 GenAI in Cybersecurity

GenAI offers utility across various cybersecurity applicationsâ€”from automating triage reports to generating hypotheses in threat hunting. However, its ability to produce convincing but inaccurate content introduces critical risks in environments that require precision and accountability.

Integrating Generative AI into cyber threat intelligence functions introduces unprecedented analytical power and considerable risk. GenAI can produce unverified, misleading, or adversarially manipulated content that undermines analytic integrity and decision-making when improperly applied. This control ensures that GenAI tools uphold the core principles of intelligence tradecraft: accuracy, objectivity, timeliness, and relevance.

Organizations should not view GenAI as a replacement for human analysts but as an augmentation tool that can accelerate collection, hypothesis generation, and linguistic processing. Intelligence personnel are responsible for interpreting, validating, and contextualizing GenAI-derived content.

### 2.2 Unique Risks in CTI

CTI workflows require high levels of fidelity, contextual understanding, and source traceability. GenAI systems that operate without constraints may introduce:
- False attribution
- Unverifiable claims
- Compromised reporting pipelines
- Unwarranted escalation of threats

### 2.3 Existing Gaps in Standards

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) and ISO/IEC 42001 provide functional foundations but do not address domain-specific use cases like GenAI in CTI. This white paper proposes a complementary, domain-specific standard.
